//Java_Home_Calculator

This is a simple java program that gives the user a cost for a house based on different variables such as style and square footage.
Once the user chooses the house style, all the other variables have default values which can be changed.

//Home.java

Home object is created and the consturctor is set with multiple private variables.
Getters and setters are created for the private vars.

//Project2.java
